## User Query

```
{query}
```

## Mandatory Instructions:

1. Find and select the **most relevant fragments** from the provided user query.
2. Preserve the **original wording** as much as possible, making **only minimal changes** necessary for clarity and coherence.
3. If needed, **lightly rephrase** for grammar or flow, but **do not fabricate, interpret beyond the original meaning, or add new information**.
4. Focus on **direct, specific answers** â€” avoid vague summaries or generalizations.
5. If the answer to the user query is not present in the context, clearly respond with: **"The requested information was not found in the provided documents."**"""
